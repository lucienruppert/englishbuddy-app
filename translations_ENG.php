3. <b>I do not know</b>: After seeing the answer, if you do not know or are not sure of it click on this button. Now the system will put it back for more practice.
4. To see the next word click on the white background again.
5. We suggest that you press \"I do not know\" until you can get all of them without any mistakes or hesitation at one go.
6. When you are done with a package you may choose <b>Another package</b> or do the same <b>One more time</b>.
- The gray number on the top indicates the number of remaining cards.
- In case an arrow appears on the top brown stripe you can use it to jump to another category of grammar.
